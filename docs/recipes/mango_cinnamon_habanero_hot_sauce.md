     Warning: Fumes produced by this recipe can be harsh on the eyes.  I recommend wearing eye protection and working in a well ventilated area.  If your kitchen doesn't have a window, try using a box fan to disperse the fumes.

Goes well with meaty dishes since the sauce is on the thicker side (porkchops, chicken, that kind of thing).  Keep sauce stored in the refrigerator to ensure longevity.
