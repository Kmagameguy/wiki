Do you like pickles but wish they stung your tongue like a thousand tiny scorpions? Here's a recipe for you.  
  
!!! warning "Caution"
    Boiling the brine produces one _heck_ of a smell.  Be sure you have good ventilation and maybe even a mask & eye protection if you're particularly sensitive to strong aromas.  You've been warned!
