# Roasting Pumpkin Seeds

A simple no-fuss recipe for roasting pumpkin seeds.

## Equipment
1. 1 large sheet pan
1. 1 large bowl
1. 1 small bowl
1. Non-stick spray, butter, or parchment paper; dealer's choice

## Ingredients
1. 1 (or more) pumpkin(s)
1. Olive oil
1. Kosher salt
1. Optional:
    - Paprika
    - Crushed black pepper
    - Chili powder (or something stronger for some HEAT)

## Directions
1. Put non-stick treament of choice on to the sheet pan
1. Scrape out the insides of the pumpkin(s) into a large bowl
1. Carefully pick out the pumpkin seeds and place them into the smaller bowl,
separating them from the gooey insides (this will take a while)
    -  _It's ok if some of the goo gets in the pan; it's inevitable really.  Try to avoid big clumps_
1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees
    - _Rack position doesn't really matter_
1. Add a couple splashes of olive oil to the small bowl, along with the salt
and other optional ingredients (season to taste, there's no wrong amounts here)
1. Toss them around with your hands, then pour the contents of the small bowl into the sheet pan
1. Spread the seeds in the pan so they are 1 layer thick
1. Make sure oven is fully pre-heated, then put the pan into the oven and roast for 20 minutes
1. The seeds should be a golden brown color when they're done;
you may need to add 5-8 minutes to the bake time depending on your oven
1.  While seeds are roasting, rinse and dry the small bowl
1. Let the seeds rest 2-3 minutes on the pan then transfer back into the small bowl and serve

This is one of my favorite Halloween-night traditions. üéÉÔ∏è
